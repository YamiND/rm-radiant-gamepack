/*QUAKED info_player_deathmatch (0 1 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 45) 
Normal player spawning location in game types without team spawns. Should touch the floor, but not the walls, and should point where the player should look when he spawns there.
-------- KEYS --------
cnt: weight of spawn point for random selection. Set to a lower value if you have many spawn points close together. Default value is 1.
target: trigger all entities with this targetname when someone spawns
targetname: when targeted by a func_button, pressing the button will assign the spawn point to the team of the activator as an additional spawn point, or reassign it if it was already assigned. Also used to assign spawn points to Onslaught control points.
restriction: when 1, only bots can spawn here; when 2, only humans can spawn here (be careful with these, or the game will crash because someone cannot spawn)
*/

/*QUAKED info_player_race (1 0.5 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 45) 
Race spawn point.
NOTE for race_place: when the race starts after the qualifying, the player with the fastest lap ends up at the info_player_race with race_place 1, and so on. If there are too many players, or if someone comes in later, he will spawn at an info_player_race with highest race_place. If someone dies after reaching the the starting checkpoint, he will spawn at race_place 0. So for each trigger_race_checkpoint, there must be at least one corresponding info_player_race with race_place NOT set.
-------- KEYS --------
target: this should point to a trigger_race_checkpoint to decide when this spawning point is active. The checkpoint has to be AFTER this spawn.
target2: trigger all entities with this targetname when someone spawns
cnt: weight of spawn point for random selection. Set to a lower value if you have many spawn points close together. Default value is 1.
race_place: if target points to the trigger_race_checkpoint with cnt 0 (finish line), this sets which place the spawn corresponds to; the special value 0 stands for spawns for players who died in game, and -1 marks the spawnpoint for qualifying mode only; any race map must have spawnpoints with race_place being 1, 2, 3 or it gets marked as a frustrating map
restriction: when 1, only bots can spawn here; when 2, only humans can spawn here (be careful with these, or the game will crash because someone cannot spawn)
