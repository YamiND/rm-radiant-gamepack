/*QUAKED trigger_killcredit (.5 .5 .5) ?
[RocketMinsta entity]

An auxiliary brush entity intended for player-triggered traps. Needs to be targeted by something, e.g. a button that activates the trap. When active, this trigger will mark every player inside it as "pushed" by the activator. This means that if someone takes damage from and/or dies to a map entity (such as a trigger_hurt, a func_door or a func_laserbeam) shortly after visiting this trigger, the activator will be credited for the damage and/or death inflicted.
-------- KEYS --------
wait: how long the trigger remains active after it has been used. Set this to however long your trap remains dangerous. The default is 3 seconds.
targetname: the name other entities can use to target this entity.

/*QUAKED trigger_relay_chance (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
[RocketMinsta entity]

A non-deterministic trigger_relay. Has a random chance to trigger all of its targets when activated.
-------- KEYS --------
cnt: the activation chance. Should be >0 and <1. 0.5 for a 50% chance, 0.75 for 75%, etc. The default is 0.5.
target: trigger all entities with this targetname when triggered
target2: trigger all entities with this targetname when triggered
target3: trigger all entities with this targetname when triggered
target4: trigger all entities with this targetname when triggered
targetname: name that identifies this entity so it can be triggered
delay: delay the triggering by the given time
message: print this message to the player who activated the trigger
killtarget: remove all entities with this targetname when triggered
*/



/*QUAKED trigger_relay_random (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
[RocketMinsta entity]

A non-deterministic trigger_relay. Triggers one of its targets when activated, chosen randomly.

It always triggers exactly one entity, even if multiple entities share the targetname that this relay targets. If you want to trigger multiple entities at once, you should route them through an additional trigger_relay instead of directly targeting them here.
-------- KEYS --------
target: trigger one of the entities with this targetname when triggered
target2: trigger one of the entities with this targetname when triggered
target3: trigger one of the entities with this targetname when triggered
target4: trigger one of the entities with this targetname when triggered
targetname: name that identifies this entity so it can be triggered
delay: delay the triggering by the given time
message: print this message to the player who activated the trigger
killtarget: remove all entities with this targetname when triggered
*/



/*QUAKED trigger_cycle (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
[RocketMinsta entity]

A self-retargeting relay-like trigger. When triggered, it first triggers its targets like a relay, then changes its "target" key to the next value in the chain, then triggers its targets again (now with the new target name). It's mainly intended to be used with "toggle"-type entities.

To construct the target chain, you must set the "chaintarget" key on the targeted entities. This key must point to the next target in the chain. The chain should eventually loop back to the original target.

Example usage:

    func_button:
        target: sequence_master

    trigger_cycle:
        targetname: sequence_master
        target: sequence_1

    func_magicwall:
        targetname: sequence_1
        chaintarget: sequence_2
        spawnflags: 8

    func_magicwall:
        targetname: sequence_2
        chaintarget: sequence_3
        spawnflags: 8

    func_magicwall:
        targetname: sequence_3
        chaintarget: sequence_1
        spawnflags: 8

-------- KEYS --------
target: the first target in the chain
targetname: name that identifies this entity so it can be triggered
delay: delay the triggering by the given time
message: print this message to the player who activated the trigger
killtarget: remove all entities with this targetname when triggered
